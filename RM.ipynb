    "    • Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to write shading codes in GLSL.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Starter Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The starter code can be downloaded from here.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Task 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the code and run it. You should be able to see a red bunny as\n",
    "shown in Fig. 1. Make sure you write your name in the appropriate place\n",
    "in the code, so it shows up at the top of the window. Here is a brief\n",
    "explanation of the starter code:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three folders in the package. “obj” contains the “bunny.obj”\n",
    "file that has the geometry information (vertex position, normal, etc.)\n",
    "for a bunny object. “shaders” contains the vertex and fragment shader\n",
    "programs. You’ll be mainly modifying these files to implement different\n",
    "shading methods. Finally, “src” contains the source files. Program is a\n",
    "class for loading, compiling, and linking the shader programs as well as\n",
    "sending data to them. Moreover, “tiny obj loader.h” is a simple header\n",
    "file for loading the obj files. You will use the Program class and “tiny\n",
    "obj loader.h” as is, but have to modify the main file. In summary,\n",
    "you’ll be modifying the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "– “main.cpp”: You need to modify this function to pass appropriate data\n",
    "to the program shaders and set up the materials and lighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "– “shader.vert”: This is the vertex shader and you’ll be filling it out\n",
    "to implement a specific shader.\n",
    "\n",
    "– “shader.frag”: This is the fragment shader and you’ll be filling it\n",
    "out to implement a specific shader.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s take a look at “main.cpp”\n",
    "\n",
    "– There are several global variables defined at the top of this file.\n",
    "Specifically, program is responsible for processing the shader programs.\n",
    "posBuff, norBuff, and texBuff store the vertex position, normal, and\n",
    "texture coordinates, respectively. materials and lights are structures\n",
    "for storing the material parameters and lighting information.\n",
    "\n",
    "– The structure of main function in “main.cpp” is similar to the one in\n",
    "all the previous assign-ments.\n",
    "\n",
    "– The Init function\n",
    "\n",
    "The first few functions are called to initializes the window and events.\n",
    "\n",
    "LoadModel function reads the obj file and saves the position, normal,\n",
    "and texture coordi-nates of each vertex of the geometry in the posBuff,\n",
    "norBuff, and texBuff vectors. We do not use the texBuff data in this\n",
    "assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last four lines are responsible for setting up the shader programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "program.SetShadersFileName sets the address of the vertex and fragment\n",
    "shader files so we can load and compile them next.\n",
    "\n",
    "1\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1: Running the skeleton code should produce a red bunny as shown\n",
    "here.\n",
    "\n",
    "program.Init loads, compiles, and links, the shader files, so they are\n",
    "ready to be exe-cuted.\n",
    "\n",
    "program.SendAttributeData sends the vertex attributes to the GPU.\n",
    "Attributes are defined at each vertex and will be directly passed as the\n",
    "input to the vertex shader program. program.SendAttributeData(posBuff,\n",
    "‘‘vPositionModel’’) sends the position of each vertex which is stored in\n",
    "posBuff to the vertex program under the name of vPositionModel. If you\n",
    "look at the vertex program (“shader.vert”), you see a vari-able called\n",
    "vPositionModel which contains the position of each vertex. Here, we send\n",
    "the position and normal of the vertices to the vertex program.\n",
    "\n",
    "– The Display function\n",
    "\n",
    "The first few lines of this function set the projection, view, and model\n",
    "matrices. These are the matrices used to project the vertices from the\n",
    "object space (the space that the positions in posBuff are given in) to\n",
    "the normalize device coordinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "program.Bind activates the shader programs so they can be used for\n",
    "drawing. Note that you can have an array of program variables each set\n",
    "up with a different vertex and shader files, e.g., program\\[0\\] set up\n",
    "with “shader0.vert” and “shader0.frag” and program\\[1\\] set up with\n",
    "“shader1.vert” and “shader1.frag”. This set up can be done in the Init\n",
    "func-tion. Then in the Display function, you can just bind the\n",
    "particular shader program that you would like to be used for drawing,\n",
    "e.g., program\\[1\\].Bind(). In fact in this as-signment you have to write\n",
    "three different shaders and be able to cycle through them using a key.\n",
    "\n",
    "program.SendUniformData sends uniform data to the shader programs (both\n",
    "vertex and fragment). These are the variables that are the same for all\n",
    "the vertices. Here, we send the model, view, and projection matrices to\n",
    "the vertex program, so we can use them to transform the vertices to\n",
    "normalize device coordinate in the vertex program. Variables model,\n",
    "view, and projection in “shader.vert” are basically these 4 4 matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "glDrawArrays basically performs the graphics pipeline including the\n",
    "shader programs to display the triangles on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, program.Unbind deactivates the shader. Now let’s look at the\n",
    "“shader.vert” and “shader.frag”\n",
    "\n",
    "2\n",
    "\n",
    "– “shader.vert”\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top, we define the two attributes vPositionModel and vNormalModel\n",
    "con-taining the position and normal of each vertex, respetively. These\n",
    "two variables are of type vec3 meaning that they have three elements.\n",
    "The data for these two variables are privided through calling\n",
    "program.SendAttributeData in the Init function of “main.cpp”. Next we\n",
    "define three uniform 4 4 matrices (mat4) to serve as the model, view,\n",
    "and pro-jection matrices. Uniform variables are constant for all the\n",
    "vertices (do not change from one vertex to another). These matrices are\n",
    "passed to the vertex shader through calling program.SendUniformData in\n",
    "the Display function of “main.cpp”.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next few lines of codes define a structure for holding the\n",
    "information about the light sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The line uniform lightStruct lights\\[NUM LIGHTS\\] creates an array of\n",
    "the previously defined light structure, called lights. Note that since\n",
    "the light sources are the same for all the vertices, they should be\n",
    "defined as uniform variables. Moreover, please note that currently no\n",
    "value is passed to these variables. You need to define these light\n",
    "sources in the “main.cpp” by indicating the position and color of each\n",
    "light source and then pass them to the vertex program by calling\n",
    "program.SendUniformData with appropriate arguments in the Display\n",
    "function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we have four uniform variables (three vec3 and one float) which\n",
    "contain infor-mation about the materials. These are the parameters\n",
    "required to calculate the color of each pixel or vertex based on the\n",
    "Phong shading model. Again the value for these variables need to be\n",
    "passed by calling program.SendUniformData with appropriate arguments in\n",
    "the Display function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next line, we define a varying variable of type vec3, called\n",
    "color. Similar to attributes, varying variables are defined per vertex.\n",
    "These are the variables that are defined in the vertex program and are\n",
    "passed in the fragment program. This is in contrast to attributes which\n",
    "are passed from CPU to the vertex program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next few lines are the main function of the vertex program. We first\n",
    "multiply the model, view, and projection matrices to transform the\n",
    "vertices stored in vPositionModel to normalized device coordinate. The\n",
    "output of this process is stored in gl Position which is a pre-defined\n",
    "output of the vertex shader. Note that, we add 1 to the end of each\n",
    "vertex to take them to homogeneous coordinate. We then define the color\n",
    "of each vertex to be red (vec3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f)).\n",
    "\n",
    "– “shader.frag”\n",
    "\n",
    "We first define the varying variable color. This is the variable that is\n",
    "passed from the vertex program to the fragment program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the main function, we set gl FragColor which is a pre-defined output\n",
    "of the frag-ment shader to be equal to color. Note that, gl FragColor\n",
    "has four elements corre-sponding to red, gree, blue, and alpha. Alpha\n",
    "defines the transparency of the color. Alpha equal to 1 means the object\n",
    "is opaque which is why we add 1 to the end of the color variable before\n",
    "passing it as gl FragColor.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Task 2\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, you will be implementing Phong shading model using Gouraud\n",
    "approach. Phong shading model uses the following equation to calculate\n",
    "the color of each point:\n",
    "\n",
    "3\n",
    "\n",
    "k\n",
    "\n",
    "Xi\n",
    "\n",
    "I = ka + Ci \\[kd max(0; Li N) + ks max(0; Ri E)s\\] : (1) =1\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this equation is slightly different from the one in the\n",
    "slides. In the slides, the ambient term is defined as kaA , but here we\n",
    "assume the intensity of the ambient illumination A is equal to (1, 1,\n",
    "1). Use the following material and light sources to implement the\n",
    "shading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Material 1\n",
    "\n",
    "– ka = (0.2, 0.2, 0.2) – kd = (0.8, 0.7, 0.7) – ks = (1.0, 1.0, 1.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "– s = 10.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Light\n",
    "\n",
    "– light 1\n",
    "\n",
    "position = (0.0, 0.0, 3.0) in world coordinate color = C1 = (0.5, 0.5,\n",
    "0.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "– light 2\n",
    "\n",
    "position = (0.0, 3.0, 0.0) in world coordinate color = C2 = (0.2, 0.2,\n",
    "0.2)\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to first set the material and light information in the\n",
    "structure arrays provided at the top of “main.cpp”. Note that materials\n",
    "is an array of size 3, but for this task you only set the first element,\n",
    "i.e., materials\\[0\\]. You need to set the other two materials and be\n",
    "able to cycle through them in the next task. Once you set material and\n",
    "light sources properly, you need to pass them to the vertex shader by\n",
    "calling program.SendUniformData with appropriate arguments in the\n",
    "Display function. Note that, the position and color of the light sources\n",
    "are defined with a structure in the shader program. You won’t be able to\n",
    "pass a structure from CPU to GPU, so you should just pass the individual\n",
    "properties for each light source. For example, you can pass the position\n",
    "of the first light source as:\n",
    "\n",
    "program.SendUniformData(lights\\[0\\].position, ‘‘lights\\[0\\].position’’)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the first argument is the name of the variable on CPU, and the\n",
    "second argument is the name of the variable on GPU inside quotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The position and color of light sources along with the material\n",
    "properties (ka; kd; ks; s) can then be used to implement Eq. 1 in the\n",
    "vertex program. I in this equation is basically the color of the vertex.\n",
    "So you need to set color (the varying variable in the vertex program) to\n",
    "I. This color is then interpolated in the graphics hardware to obtain\n",
    "the color of each pixel (fragment). The varying variable color in the\n",
    "fragment shader is the interpolated color and thus setting gl FragColor\n",
    "to this color variable in the fragment shader results in outputting the\n",
    "shaded pixels. Since the shading is done in the vertex program (per each\n",
    "vertex) and the color of each pixel is obtained by interpolating the\n",
    "color at the three vertices, this shader is the implementation of the\n",
    "Gouraud approach. Note that, the interpolation is done on the graphics\n",
    "hardware in the processes between vertex and fragment shaders and you do\n",
    "not need to implement it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, in order to implement Eq. 1, in addition to the materials and\n",
    "light properties, you need to compute Li; N; Ri; and E. As discussed in\n",
    "the class, you can compute them either in the world space or\n",
    "\n",
    "4\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2: The outcome of task 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "camera space. Let’s say you choose to compute them in the world space.\n",
    "In this case, the position of the vertices and normals (vPositionModel\n",
    "and vNormalModel) are in the object space. So you have to first\n",
    "transform them properly using the model transformation to the world\n",
    "space (you have to be careful about normal transformation, as discussed\n",
    "in the class). Since position of light sources and eye is given in the\n",
    "world space, they do not require any transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you implement this task correctly, you should be able to see a bunny\n",
    "shown in Fig. 2\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Task 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you’ll be creating two more materials and add keyboard hooks to be\n",
    "able to cycle through these materials with the m/M keys (m moves\n",
    "forward, while M moves backward). The two additional materials are as\n",
    "follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Material 2\n",
    "\n",
    "– ka = (0.0, 0.2, 0.2)\n",
    "\n",
    "– kd = (0.5, 0.7, 0.2) – ks = (0.1, 1.0, 0.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "– s = 100.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Material 3\n",
    "\n",
    "– ka = (0.2, 0.2, 0.2)\n",
    "\n",
    "– kd = (0.1, 0.3, 0.9) – ks = (0.1, 0.1, 0.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "– s = 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "The rendered bunny using these two materials and Gouraud approach is\n",
    "shown in Fig. 3\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Task 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you’ll be implementing two more shaders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phong approach for shading – As discussed in the class, the Phong\n",
    "approach performs per-pixel shading, as opposed to per-vertex shading in\n",
    "Gouraud approach. This is very similar to the what you implemented for\n",
    "the Gouraud approach. Here, instead of calculating Eq. 1 in the vertex\n",
    "shader, you\n",

    "Figure 3: The rendered bunny using material 2 (left) and 3 (right).\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 4: The rendered bunny using Phong approach (material 1) (left)\n",
    "and silhouette shader (right).\n",
    "\n",
    "have to implement it in the fragment shader and directly set the final\n",
    "color I to gl FragColor. Of course in this case, you need to pass the\n",
    "materials and lighting information as well as other variables to the\n",
    "fragment shader to be able to do the computations. The outcome of this\n",
    "shader for material 1 is shown in Fig. 4 (left).\n",
    "\n",
    "Silhouette shader To implement a silhouette shader, you need to color\n",
    "every fragment black, except for the ones that the angle between the\n",
    "normal and eye is close to 90 . For this, you need to compute the dot\n",
    "product of the normal and eye vector and threshold the results. Make\n",
    "sure the threshold is chosen properly so you get similar result to Fig.\n",
    "4 (right). Note that this shader doesn’t use the light or material\n",
    "information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pressing ’1’, ’2’, and ’3’ should switch to Gouraud, Phong, and\n",
    "Silhouette shaders, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, you need to implement each shader approach in a set of\n",
    "different shader files, e.g., Gouraud in “shader1.vert” and\n",
    "“shader1.frag”, Phong in “shader2.vert” and “shader2.frag”, and\n",
    "silhouette in “shader3.vert” and “shader3.frag”. You should also create\n",
    "an array of program. Then in the Init function you as-sign a particular\n",
    "shader to each program element (e.g., program\\[0\\] for Gouraud –\n",
    "“shader1.vert” and “shader.frag”) and load and compile all of these\n",
    "shaders and pass appropriate attributes to them. In the Display code,\n",
    "you should then bind the correct shader program based on the keyboard\n",
    "input.\n",
    "\n",
    "6\n",
    "\n",
    "    • Task 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide the ability to move the light sources. The user should be able\n",
    "to cycle through the two light sources with l/L (l move forward and L\n",
    "move backward) and move the selected light source in x, y, and z axis\n",
    "using keys x/X, y/Y, and z/Z, respectively; Positive direction for lower\n",
    "case letters and negative direction for upper case letters.\n",
